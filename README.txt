The age of an abalone can be determined by cutting the shell open, staining it and counting the number of rings on it
through a microscope, which can be tedious and time consuming. This python script uses a dataset of approximately 
4200 abalone examples with measurements of shell length, diameter, height, etc and creates a neural network model that 
predicts the rings of a random abalone.
